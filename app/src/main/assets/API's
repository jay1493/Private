1.)Using MediaPlayer and SurfaceView combination to stream online Youtube Videos is not possible, also using
   VideoView and MediaPlayerController combination did'nt do the trick, so it could be done via:

YouTubePlayerAPI, or ExoPlayer(Underlying Structure of Youtube App)
a.)  -For Using YouTubeApi, just include its dependency.
     -Then in layout use <com......youtube.youtubePlayerView>
     -After defining layout, extends your activity with YouTubeBaseActivity which inFact extends Activity class.
     -In your activity class, initialize the youTubeView(as defined in layout), now using initialize() method,
        of this view, we require a -String parameter, which inFact is our API key(YouTubeAPI key) as made from
        GoogleDeveloperConsole,and a - Callbacks
     -Now in onInitializationSuccess Callback use cueVideo(<ID OF YOUTUBE VIDEO>) method of videoPlayer object.
